# Python Course - World 1 (Fundamentals)

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises from **World 1** of the Python course provided by [Curso em Vídeo](https://www.youtube.com/c/CursoemVídeo), taught by Professor Gustavo Guanabara.

# About the Module
**World 1** introduces the fundamentals of the Python language. The main goal is to develop algorithmic thinking and understand the basic syntax.

# Topics Covered:
- **Handling Data:** Primitive types (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`) and output (`print`, `input`).
- **Arithmetic Operators:** Calculations, precedence order, and math operations.
- **Using Modules:** Importing libraries like `math`, `random`, and `time`.
- **Text Manipulation:** Analyzing, slicing, and transforming strings.
- **Conditional Structures (Part 1):** Simple and compound conditions (`if`, `else`).
